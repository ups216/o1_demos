Write an interactive visualization code of self attention of Transformer in HTML and javascript without any libraries.

- Use an example sentence?"The quick brown fox"
- When hovering over a token, visualize the edges whose thicknesses are proportional to the attention score.
- The edges should be curved and should not overlap each other.
- Make sure that the edges start and end from each token's center 
- When clicked on a token, show the value of attention scores.

Visualize this nicely in a latex-rendered vector notation. Put each token next to the score. Make sure the Latex rendering is well-aligned.

- When clicked again, remove the attention score vector.
- have vertical spacing of 50px at the top
