Implement Snake with HTML + JS + CSS. The entire code should be written in a single HTML block with embedded JS and CSS. Don't use any remote assets. After opening the html, user will need to hit space to start / restart the game, the snake will randomly go in one direction at the start and use "wasd" to control the direction of the snake. Make it pretty and the playground large.
